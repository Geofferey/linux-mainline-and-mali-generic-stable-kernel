# my kind of generic armv7l 32bit linux mainline stable kernel build

i'm using this kernel on the following devices:
* bananapi m1
* asus tinkerboard
* tx1 allwinner h3 tv box
* r39 allwinner h3 tv box
* orbsmart s92 tv box (same as beelink r89, tronsmart orion r28, very similar to ubox tv box)
* raspberry pi 3b and 3b plus in 32bit mode

some notes regarding the generic 32bit armv7l kernel:

- see readme.av7 for instructions to build the kernel from sources and patches (this is not a shell script)

in case the readme.av7 instructions are not clear enough, please have a look at
- https://forum.odroid.com/viewtopic.php?f=55&t=3691&p=276318#p276318
- https://github.com/rodolfoap/kernel-odroid-u3/blob/master/README.md

maybe afterwards its more clear how it is ment to work ...
